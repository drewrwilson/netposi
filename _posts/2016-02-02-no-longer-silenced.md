In this episode [Rosemarie Lerner](https://twitter.com/roslerner) tells us about [Quipu](https://interactive.quipu-project.com/), her transmedia documentary which is creating a digital archive with the testimonies of the people who were sterilized against their will in Peru in the 90s during Fujimori's regime. Leveraging on the power of the Web, Quipu seeks justice for the hundreds of people who have been waiting to be heard for decades.
