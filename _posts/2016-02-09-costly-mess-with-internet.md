description: In this episode Evan Greer talks to us about her work as a musician, and as campaign director for Fight For The Future, the non-profit that organized the massive 2012 campaign against SOPA/PIPA. We talk about how Fight For The Future approaches issue campaigning, and why shifting cultural paradigms are more important than winning legal battles.
